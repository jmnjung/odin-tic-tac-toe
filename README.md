# odin-tic-tac-toe

This project is a [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game migrated from a console-based version to a web-based UI, developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course.
The game allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe in the browser, featuring an interactive and responsive design.
The game features a simple user interface where players can enter their names, take turns to place their marks, and view the result once the game is over.

The console version of this game was created following [this article](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out).
This resource is excellent, providing the foundation for the game logic and structure with [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) as an example.
The web version was built to provide a more interactive and accessible experience.

## Future Improvements

While this project meets the basic functionality, here are some potential improvements that could be added in the future:

- Implement a computer opponent using basic AI.
- Add animations and transitions for smoother user experience.
- Make the game fully accessible with ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
- Refactor the code to support dynamic board sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).
